# CSCI499 Special Topics (Advanced Data Science)

This class is a structured, collaborative study of advanced topics in Data Science. During the semester, students will apply the data analytics lifecycle to a research topic of their choosing. Students will select appropriate predictive analytical methods for their topics and evaluate its social and ethical implications. Individual work will complement peer collaboration as students explore issues of visualizing and communicating data to each other and to the public.

Class repository is maintained on [GitHub/MoreDataScience](https://github.com/MoreDataScience/CSCI499-Spring2019) and hosted on [MoreDataScience.github.io/CSCI499-Spring2019/](https://moredatascience.github.io/CSCI499-Spring2019/).

| Collaboration and Version Control with R projects | Create a GitHub repository for your project portfolio and make it [host a public site](https://pages.github.com/) that will include your code and [blog](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and review how to [maintain version control and collaborate](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) using Git. [Join](https://join.slack.com/t/moredatascience/shared_invite/enQtNTM2NjAzNDc4NzExLThhZmEzOTRjNjZkYjZmNmIxYmEwOWQ0Njg5Y2JiNWU2ODA5NGZiOTY0YzQwM2I4NDM2ZmY2MjA2ZTllODIzZTc) the [class slack channel](https://moredatascience.slack.com/) and use it for all out-of-class communication, including questions and when you need assistance. As a first entry for your blog, identify a [/r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) post that interests you and summarize a critique for it. As a first commit to your code, identify a research topic and edit your `README.md` to provide a brief expanation, including where you expect to find the source(s) of your data. Finally, submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to edit this document with the topic area you choose to lead and a link to your site. | February 8 | Kevin Buffardi |
